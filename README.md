# GuardianAngelMobile
1. Sync the Project and install all the gradle dependencies.
2. After running the mobile application you will be able to see the screen with options to give text and audio prompt.
3. Sending the text prompts to the backend will fail the API but you will be able to see the overall structure of the application which constitutes my contribution.
